<em>I had my first contact with programming when I was messing around with GameMaker, I was very young at that time, I downloaded it for pure curiosity and made some little games with it. Years later, I took some programming courses to understand this area more. I have interest in game development, but it doesn't stop there! Make yourself at home, take a look around!</em> 😄
