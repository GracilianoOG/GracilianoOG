I had my first contact with programming when I was messing around with GameMaker 8, I was very young at that time, I downloaded it for pure curiosity and made some little games with it. Years later, I grew up and at sixteen years old I decided to take some courses and understand this area more. I've been studying programming ever since! I have interest in game development, but it doesn't stop there! 💡

## Technologies I have some experience with 👨‍💻
